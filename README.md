# ðŸ”¬ Hata's Lab

A digital laboratory space that documents my journey of connecting ideas, experiments, and personal growth.

## About This Space

Hata's Lab is a minimalist Jekyll site hosted on GitHub Pages, designed to serve as a personal thinking environment where I document my journey as a games developer, thinker, and builder.

This is not a traditional portfolio or product showcase, but rather a living workspace where ideas connect and thoughts take shape.

## Core Philosophy

I believe in the beauty of connection - how ideas, people, and experiences intertwine to create something greater than their parts. Like a laboratory where elements combine to form new compounds, this space exists to observe and document that process.

The power isn't in the specific technologies or languages (those are just tools), but in the structural thinking that builds meaningful solutions.

## Content Types

This laboratory contains various types of content:

- **Blog Posts**: Longer-form thoughts and reflections
- **Lab Notes**: Quick observations and connections between ideas (250-500 words)
- **Experiments**: Documented processes with outcomes and reflections (500-1500 words)

## Technical Framework

- Built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages
- Minimalist design prioritizing content and readability
- Separate collections for different content types
- Light/dark mode support
- Focus on performance and accessibility

## For Observers

This space exists primarily as my digital thinking environment. If you find something that resonates, sparks curiosity, or teaches you something new - that's a wonderful side effect, not the primary goal.

Consider yourself an observer in this laboratory. No pressure to interact, just an open invitation to witness the experiments.

*Simplicity in each element. Beauty in their combination.*

# Chirpy Starter

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders
`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file
from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command
`bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user's court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ _plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ _tabs
â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the
latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.
