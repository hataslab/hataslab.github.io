# Lab Experiments

This is where I document my hands-on explorations and practical tests. Each experiment follows a structured format:

1. **Context/Background** - What led to this experiment
2. **The Experiment** - What I'm trying to learn or test
3. **Process** - How I conducted the experiment
4. **Results** - What happened during the experiment
5. **Reflection/Connection** - What I learned and how it connects to other ideas
6. **Next Questions** - What I'm curious about next

These experiments span various domains but often focus on game development, software architecture, and creative problem-solving.
