# Lab Notes

This section contains shorter observations, connections, and thoughts (250-500 words). Each note follows a simple structure:

1. **Context** - The background or trigger for the observation
2. **Observation** - What I noticed or thought about
3. **Connection** - How this connects to other ideas or domains
4. **Next Questions** - What I'm curious about going forward

These notes are the building blocks of my thinking process - capturing ideas before they develop into full experiments or essays.
