  <h2>Welcome to the experiment</h2>
  
  <p>This is where ideas connect, where thoughts take shape, and where the journey of self-improvement unfolds. Not a showcase, but a living workspace.</p>
  
  <div class="lab-showcase">
    <h2>What is this place?</h2>
    
    <p>Hata's Lab isn't a product repository or a portfolio in the traditional sense. It's a space where I document my journey as a games developer, thinker, and builder. A personal laboratory where I:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Share original thoughts and experiences</li>
      <li>Connect seemingly unrelated concepts</li>
      <li>Track my progress in creating software and game solutions</li>
      <li>Explore the philosophy of self-improvement in mind, body, and soul</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>The philosophy</h2>
  
  <p>I believe in the beauty of connection - how ideas, people, and experiences intertwine to create something greater than their parts. Like a laboratory where elements combine to form new compounds, this space exists to observe and document that process.</p>
  
  <p>The power isn't in the specific technologies or languages (those are just tools), but in the structural thinking that builds meaningful solutions.</p>
  
  <h2>Why "Lab"?</h2>
  
  <p>A lab is the birthplace of ideas, where curiosity leads and experiments happen freely. It's where connections form between knowledge and experience. It's not about having all the answers, but about asking interesting questions.</p>
  
  <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
  
  <p>This space exists primarily as my digital thinking environment. If you find something that resonates, sparks curiosity, or teaches you something new - that's a wonderful side effect, not the primary goal.</p>
  
  <p>Consider yourself an observer in this laboratory. No pressure to interact, just an open invitation to witness the experiments.</p>
